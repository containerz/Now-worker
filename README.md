# Now-worker

We created now as a way to find realtime checkins around the globe.
We use the Twitter streaming API for finding all the tweets with a swarmapp link, which we then send to the Foursquare API for getting the check-in JSON response.
We use appbase.io to transform this into queriable live data.
We put together a small frontend that allows neat filtering based on city selection and categories or by browsing the map view.
Without further ado, here are the important links: now worker code, now and the demo.
